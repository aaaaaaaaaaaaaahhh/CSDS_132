1. GibberishWriterTester
    1. for each method that has a loop, none
     of them require really testing 0, 1, 
     or many of them. many of them require looping
     through each generated list and comparing it
     to a list of expected values. this tests
     the first, middle, and last values accordingly
2. ContextDataTester
    1. same thing from GibberishWriterTester, but 
    with some error handling as well. I did not fully
    test the compareTo method because it is just
    using the compareTo method of Context
3. ContextTester
    1. for testing the getLength method, testing 0
    would look like giving it a Context of length
    0 and asking the length, same for 1 and many.
    this is the same design used for the toString,
    compareTo, and equals methods
4. LLIteratorTester
    1. same basic principle here as the others,
    adding after and before were each tested for
    the beginning, middle, and end of the list
5. LinkedListTester
    1. just tests the toArrayList method using 
    previous techniques
6. WordDataTester
    1. just testing basic getters and setters
