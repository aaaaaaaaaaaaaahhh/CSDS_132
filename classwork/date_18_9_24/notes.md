Strings: non-primitive values
- \+ operator
    - creates a BRAND NEW string that concatenates the operands
    - "hi" + "class" returns "hiclass"
    - 3 + 4 + "value" returns "7value"
    - "value" + 3 + 4 returns "value34" 

<p>
when you override an inherited method, the class doing the overriding can still access the inherited method using: super.methodName(inputs).The original method can only be accessed in the body of the class. To all code outside your class, the new method has replaced the inherited method.
