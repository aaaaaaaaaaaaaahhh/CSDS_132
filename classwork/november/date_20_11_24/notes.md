## design paradigms
1. top down
   1. we break the problem into tasks
   2. we break each task into subtasks
   3. repeat until we have something small enough we can code it
   4. EX:
      1. Chutes and Ladders top down design
         1. create a board
            1. make a grid of spaces
            2. put in the chutes and ladders
            3. 
         2. create players
         3. create a die
         4. play the game
2. bottom up
   1. code something that may relate to the project
   2. code something else
   3. repeat and start combinging the pieces together
