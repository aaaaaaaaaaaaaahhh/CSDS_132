## polymorphism
1. a non primitive value is many types at the same time
2. true type:
    1. what class the value is as created by new
    2. never changes
3. current type
    1. which of the valid polymorphic types is the value typecast to at this moment in the program
    2. changes what instance methods we can call
        1. only methods valid for that current type
        2. the true type version of the instance method is always used
    3. also determines the fields accessed and class methods used and run

## java api: application program interface
1. lists all classes( and other types) and protected and public methods and fields and nested types of those types
