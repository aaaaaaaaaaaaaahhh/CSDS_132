- Date Class

create an instance with Date d = new Date(31, 12, 2000) in the interactions terminal,
then call d.getDay(), d.getMonth(), and d.getYear(), which should return 31, 12, and 2000 respectively

To test the incrementeDate() and toString() method (as well as some other functionality), call
d.incrementeDate(), then d.toString() which should return "January 1, 2001". To test this effectively,
you should repeat this test with the Date objects Date d1 = new Date(11, 11, 1700), 
Date d2 = new Date(28, 2, 2500), and Date d3 = new Date(31, 12, 2200), each calling incrementeDate() twice

to test daysPerMonth(), just call Date.daysPerMonth() using each number from 1 to 12. The outputs should
be the number of days in the month corresponding to its number. Also input a number outside of the range
and the output should be 0


retart your interactions window then,
to test equals() and sameEffectiveDayAs(), create 3 Date instances: Date d3 = new Date(28, 12, 2010),
Date d4 = new Date(28, 2, 2000), and Date d5 = new Date(28, 12, 2000) call d4.sameEffectiveDayAs(d3)
which should return true and d4.equals(d3) which should return false. then call d3.equals(d5) which
should return true. finally, increment the date of d3 and call d4.sameEffectiveDayAs(d3) again. the
result should be true
